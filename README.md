# predic_chronic_kidney_disease
In this project ***I have  predict whether person has chronic kidney disease or not chronic kidney disease??*** and developed the machine learning module . before the developed module  I have analysis the data  and got informative insights . ***some graph not show because it is plotly graph i have attches Screen shots of plotly graph check it***  firstly imported the data using pandas library  and imported all required libraries. such as  numpy as np , seaborn as sns , matplotlib.pyplot as plt  , and plotly for visualization .  and for developing machine learning module   import  sklearn .
***handling the missing values , clean,analyze and visualized the data.***
then  checking feature  distribution, feature selection , select independent and dependent varibale , model  building  and import randomserch  and classifier algorithm 
and good thing is that I have got 1.0 % accuracy  and visualized the confusion matrix .
